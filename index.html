									The "home outside the home" of the Rowdy Reptiles, Gate 3 is the student entrance to the Stephen C. O'Connell Center. Because the earliest ones get the best seats, students have been known to line up and wait outside of Gate 3 for hours and even days with tailgate chairs, blankets and even tents. For the spring 2014 game featuring the #1 ranked Gators against rival Kentucky, more than 400 students camped out overnight in a line that stretched down Stadium Road. Students have used #OccupyGate3 on social media to chronicle their experiences.

The song's iconic cadence give students a great beat to jump and sing to. Midway through the song, everyone quiets down, cups their hand around their ear, and listens to the piccolo solo.
